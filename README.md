# Java Console Calculator

A simple **Command-Line Interface (CLI) based calculator** to perform basic arithmetic operations.

## Objective
To build a Java program that allows users to **add, subtract, multiply, and divide** numbers using a structured approach.

## Features
- **Addition** – Adds two numbers.  
- **Subtraction** – Subtracts the second number from the first.  
- **Multiplication** – Multiplies two numbers.  
- **Division** – Divides the first number by the second and handles division by zero.  
- **Looped Operations** – Allows multiple calculations until the user chooses to exit.  

## Implementation Details
- **Methods for Each Operation** – `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()`, `divide()`.  
- **Scanner Class** – Used to take user input from the console.  
- **Menu-Driven Interface** – Provides intuitive options for performing calculations.  
- **Error Handling** – Prevents division by zero and handles invalid menu choices.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a practical example of **object-oriented programming in Java**. It reinforces the use of **methods, loops, conditionals, and user input handling** in a simple, interactive console application.
